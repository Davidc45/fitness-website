# CPSC-349 Final Project
This project is worked on by David Calderon and Dustin Olinger. The tech stack consists of React and Tailwindcss. We will design implement and present a fitness tracking website which will let users track their training journey. Users will be able to track and visualize their progress to get that extra breach of confidence in order to push on with their journey for better health.
